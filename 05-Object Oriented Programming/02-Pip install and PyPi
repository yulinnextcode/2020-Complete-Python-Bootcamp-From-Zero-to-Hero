1. PyPi
    PyPi is a repository for open-source third-party Python packages.
    
    We can use libraries that come internally with Python.
    There are also many other libraries available that people have open-sourced and shared on PyPi.
    
    We can use pip install at the command line to install these packages.
    
    pip is a simple way to download packages at your command line directly from the PyPi repository
    
2. Install pip

    Command Prompt
    pip install
