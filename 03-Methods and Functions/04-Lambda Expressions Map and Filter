1. map function
    The map function allows you to "map" a function to an iterable object. That is to say you can quickly call the same function to every item in an iterable, such as a list. 
    
2. The filter function returns an iterator yielding those items of iterable for which function(item) is true. Meaning you need to filter by a function that returns either True or False. Then passing that into filter (along with your iterable) and you will get back only the results that would return True when passed to the function.

3. lambda expression
    One of Pythons most useful (and for beginners, confusing) tools is the lambda expression. lambda expressions allow us to create "anonymous" functions. 
    
    Function objects returned by running lambda expressions work exactly the same as those created and assigned by defs.
    
    lambda's body is a single expression, not a block of statements.
