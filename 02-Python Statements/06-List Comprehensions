List Comprehensions
    List comprehensions allow us to build out lists using a different notation. You can think of it as essentially a one line for loop built inside of brackets.
    
    mystring = 'hello'
    mylist=[]
    for letter in mystring:
      mylist.append(letter)
      
    mylist=[letter for letter in 'hello']
    
flatten out the for loop
    lst = [x for x in range(11) if x % 2 == 0]
    
    for x in [2,4,6]:
      for y in [1,10,100]:
        mylist.append(x*y)
        
    mylist = [x*y for x in [2,4,6] for y in [1,10,100]]
