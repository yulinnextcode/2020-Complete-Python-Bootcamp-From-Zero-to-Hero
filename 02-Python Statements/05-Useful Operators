1. range
    The range function allows you to quickly generate a list of integers, this comes in handy a lot, so take note of how to use it! There are 3 parameters you can pass, a start, a stop, and a step size. 

2. enumerate
    enumerate is a very useful function to use with for loops.
    
3. zip
    return a tuple
    
4. in
    We've already seen the in keyword during the for loop, but we can also use it to quickly check if an object is in a list
    
5. not in
    We can combine in with a not operator, to check if some object or variable is not present in a list.
    
6. min and max
    Quickly check the minimum or maximum of a list with these functions.

7. random
    Python comes with a built in random library. There are a lot of functions included in this random library, so we will only show you two useful functions for now.
    
8. input
    input('Enter Something into this box: ')
